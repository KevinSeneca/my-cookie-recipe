					<h2>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
					<p>Every kitchen needs a gold standard recipe for chocolate chip cookies. This one has earned its
						stripes under fire, over many seasons, through countless licked spoons, spilled vanilla and
						extra
						chips in the batter. Its quick baking time is the key to addictively chewy cookies that friends
						and
						family won’t be able to resist.</p>
					<p>By Chef Michael Smith</p>
					<p><span>YIELD:</span>Makes about 18 cookies (depending on how much of the cookie dough you eat!)

				<h2>Procedure</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Preheat your oven to 375 °F (190 °C).</li>
					<li>Whisk the flour, baking powder and salt together and set aside.</li>
					<li>Using a stand mixer or a food processor, cream the butter and sugar together until smooth. If
						you don’t
						have a stand mixer, beat vigorously by hand in a large mixing bowl.</li>
					<li>Add the corn syrup, egg and vanilla and continue beating until well combined. Scrape down the
						bowl and
						gradually add the flour mixture, beating just until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
					<li>Using a spoon, scoop out a ball of the dough, roll it for a moment in your hands and then drop
						it onto a
						lightly greased cookie tray. Slightly flatten the balls but leave lots of room in between to
						allow the
						cookies room to expand.</li>
					<li>For a soft, chewy cookie, bake for exactly 12 minutes. For a cookie with a bit of crispy crunch,
						bake
						for exactly 15 minutes.</li>
					<li>Cool for 2 minutes on the cookie sheet and then remove and cool further.</li>
				</ol>

				<p><b>VARIATION:</b> For a richer chocolate flavour, add 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder to the dry
					ingredients.
					For an extra special treat, substitute M&amp;M’s for the chips.</p>
